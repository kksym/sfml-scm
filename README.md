sfml-scm
========
[Chicken Scheme](http://www.call-cc.org/) bindings for the [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) C++ multimedia library, using the [CSFML](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/CSFML) C binding as the underlying interface. This is supposed to be a low level binding without any niceties, and aims to be as semantically close to the CSFML library as possible.

Installation
------------
Run `chicken-install` in the project base directory.

Dependencies
------------
 - [SFML](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML)
 - [CSFML](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/CSFML)

Please note that this library will not work with SFML 1.6, you must have 2.0+.
